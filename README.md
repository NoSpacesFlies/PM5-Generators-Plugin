WARNING: This plugin needs a very fast ram & high ghz cpu

NOTE: This is the portable version and it does not have an api calculator
NOTE: Catcore one has a delay calculator, this one spawns gen/ore every 60 ticks(3s), open pull request for better delay per stack.
NOTE: This does not contain CatCore gen api(so its unusable in another plugins)
